Hi, I'm Katze.

I do sysadmin stuff, dabble in some SRE related activities, are pretty deep into networking, and do some development occasionally.

Thanks to the ever more aggressive and both unsustainable and probably license violating use of LLMs and stuff on GitHub I've started moving everything to my own git.
This comes at the added benefit of also having IPv6 (which GitHub *still doesn't after decades*).
So unless you're stuck on *Legacy IPâ„¢*, why not go and check out all the projects I've removed from GitHub?
